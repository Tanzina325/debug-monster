                  <strong>Differences between local storage and session storage are given below: </strong> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. And the  storage capacity of session storage is 5MB</li>
                    <li>As the local storage is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually. Otherhand, the session storage is session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed</li>
                    <li>
                        The main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that the localStorage stores data with no expiration date, while the sessionStorage stores data from one session.</li>
                        <li>Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.	Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications.</li>
                        <li>This is especially useful for storing data that you want to persist even if the user closes the browser, such as preferences or settings.	Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.</li>
                        <li>The data is stored on the browser and system.	The data is stored on the browser only.</li>

                  <strong>Differences between global scope and block scope are given below:</strong> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Before ES6, JavaScript only had function and global scope. This meant that a variable declared inside a function lived inside the function and a variable declared outside a function could live anywhere. This means that variables declared inside if statements or other code blocks are globally scoped and live outside their code block.On the otherhand,With ES6, JavaScript introduced the let keyword and block scope. Block scope means that if a variable is declared using let or const in a code block it lives only in that code block.</li>
                    <li>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.And The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.

                    The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

                        <li>var declaration problem is the variable hoisting within the function scope. You can declare a var variable somewhere at the end of the function scope, but still, you can access it before declaration: and you'll get an undefined.</li>
                        <li>When accessing a non-existing object property, JavaScript returns undefined</li>
